# This is a project composed by [jordyn](http://jordandashel.com)

It is intended to be a learning excercise with Elixir. While the code is not _bad_, 
it is Elixir baby-talk for me, being new to the language. Please excuse any violation
of norms.

What this project really needs is tests. It has a decent end-to-end python script that
can be run to be sure everything works as expected from an api perspective, but it by 
no means scours the corners of the code for errors.

It was a lot of fun designing with the agent/supervisor model! Although perhaps the 
"generate a new agent based on user-provided term" is probably not the best solution, 
it works fine in this scenario and was terrific as a learning activity.
